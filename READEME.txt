this is pretty simple.  a good designer could make it even better!  feel free to modify the stylesheets and the layout as needed.

NOTE!
-in order for this to work, the individual albums must be placed in the "photos" folder, and must be named sequentially like so:
	album1
	album2
	album3
	... and so on...

-also there must be an image in each album labled "thumbnail.jpg", which (you guessed it) serves as the thumbnail image for the album itself.

that's it... let me know if you need any other assistance!
